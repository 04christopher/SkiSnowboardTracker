# My Personal Project

## Ski and Snowboard Run Tracker and Organizer

This application will allow you to record, review, and plan your Ski Trips.
For each mountain, you will be able to view the trails that are available and 
information about them such as **difficulty, length**, and **features** (such as moguls, trees, etc.). 
For each run, you can also track your own information, such as the amount of times you've done a run, personal bests and average times,
total runs done,
total elevation and length travelled, and more.

This application will be useful to anyone who Skis or Snowboards in the lower mainland! Users can use this application to look at information
and track and plan  their own trips.

I'm interested in building this project because this is an application with features that I 
would actually use in my active life, and I can share it with others in Vancouver.
